# Pixel Perfect React.js Development Project (EigerX)

## 🚀 About This Project

Welcome to this **Pixel Perfect React.js Development** project! This project is developed using **TypeScript** and is designed to ensure a flawless design-to-code transformation with attention to detail.

### 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling
- **React-Router-Dom** for routing
- **classnames** for conditional classNames management
- **SCSS** for advanced styling needs

I focus on delivering high-quality, pixel-perfect UI with best practices in mind, while ensuring that the code is efficient and scalable. 👨‍💻✨

## 🔍 Important Notes for Reviewers

### ⚠️ Potential Design Mismatches

While I strive for pixel-perfect development, there may be slight differences of 1-2px in some cases, especially when working with different screen resolutions, browser rendering behaviors, or anti-aliasing issues. 🖥️👀 These differences are generally minimal and do not impact functionality, but may be noticeable to keen-eyed reviewers. I appreciate your understanding! ✌️
